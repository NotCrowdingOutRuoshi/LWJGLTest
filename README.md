LWJGLTest
====
An example of LWJGL2.0 including identity projection(used in 2D game), texturing and input handling.
And also every program need comments.
You can keep add comment to code, if it helps others to understand how it works.

Dependency
----
Use eclipse of course. All dependency libs are all include in the project.
All you need to do is just change location of native libraries for your OS to lib/native/<your os>.
